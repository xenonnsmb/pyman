# pyman
Pyman is a web-based Python script manager. It lets you easily start and stop Python scripts from the web.
## Dependencies
Pyman requires Python 3 and web.py.
## Installing
Clone the repository somewhere on your computer. Edit the main.py file to add your scripts as tasks (documentation is inside the file.) It is reccomended that you follow a guide to installing web.py as a part of a web server like Apache, and then turn on the server's password feature, so only you can use your Pyman control panel.
